# Odin-recipes

This is a trail run and understanding what HTML entails.

We will conducting how to do a recipe and more in the days coming forward!

Learning alot currently I will need to dig deeper into git and how to add more docs into it. So far so good just a lil training needed.

This was a little fun activity and very different also. 

I am struggling with git commands but again the more I do it the more I would understand.

I guess this is my journal input and honestly pretty cool because i can reflect on it now.

This is my first ever published site with the more techniacal aspect looking forward to what the odin project has.

P.S i fell like the recipes was  bit going in a cycle thats why I dident input much on the pasta part. However it was fun and now I will try to make better sites.

Day 0 out of 100 of coding accomplished!
